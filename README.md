"""
Process IR and Raman Data of Contaminated Plastic to Streamline Washing and Sorting Procedures
"""

# Description
"""
Plastic washing and sorting is an essesital step in reacycling strategies, but the positive ID rate of mixed plastic waste remains very low. This study proposes using IR and Raman spectroscopy to analyze mixed plastic before the washing step, allowing for increased information to add to existing visual identification systems. This also has the potential to allow for a tailored washing process, with each piece of recycling being washed in a way according to the detected contaminants.
